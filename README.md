# üåå **chicha-isotope-map** ‚Äî The Explorer of Invisible Roads

> **"Is there anyone who can see the invisible? No? Well, this program can. It takes radioactive traces, just like an old shaman reads from ashes, and brings them to life on the screen ‚Äî colorful, glowing, alive."**

---

## üìñ **About the Project**

**Isotope Pathways** isn‚Äôt just a program; it‚Äôs a gateway to a world of invisible particles, now made visible. Imagine walking down the road, and beneath your feet, radioactive isotopes are dancing. This program reveals them. It creates a map where every isotope leaves a trace, from green to red, from calm to warning.

It can read data from AtomFast and RadiaCode formats, such as `.kml`, `.kmz`, `.json`, and `.rctrk`, and store them in its own database. So, years later, you can look back and say, "Back in 2024, right here, the radiation was 4.1 ¬µR/h."

### üåç **Based on Nature**

We‚Äôve built this program using the **natural background radiation** as a baseline. If you go to a clean, untouched place, you‚Äôll likely see **3-4 microroentgens per hour**. That‚Äôs normal. At different altitudes, radiation levels vary, and the planet dances along with it.

Anything above this baseline is considered **foreign**. That‚Äôs what we call **radioactive contamination**. You can see how isotopes scatter across roads, carried by the wind, by people, and by vehicles. These small, invisible traces are like footprints left behind on freshly fallen snow.

### üì∏ **Screenshots**

... In Soviet times, an open swimming pool was being built in Kislovodsk Park. Maybe they used concrete from a factory in Pyatigorsk, where radioactive ore from Mount Beshtau was once processed. Trucks drove down the roads, and dust from their wheels settled on the asphalt, leaving invisible marks. Years have passed, yet these traces still glow, like memories of the past. The dust that spread around the construction settled in the park ‚Äî on the map, it shows up in yellow, like patches of autumn leaves. Everything else in the park remains clean, peaceful, and green.

## Install and run on Linux amd64:

```bash
curl https://files.zabiyaka.net/chicha-isotope-map/latest/no-gui/linux/amd64/chicha-isotope-map > /usr/local/bin/chicha-isotope-map; chmpod +x /usr/local/bin/chicha-isotope-map; /usr/local/bin/chicha-isotope-map;
```

---

## üõ† **How to Use?**

### Run the program:

```bash
chicha-isotope-map
```

or with additional settings:

```bash
chicha-isotope-map --port=8765 --db-type=genji --db-path=./path-to-database-file.8765.genji
```

#### Supported Database Types:
- `genji`: Fast, lightweight embedded database with no external dependencies.
- `sqlite`: A file-based database popular for local storage.
- `pgx` (PostgreSQL): Connect to a PostgreSQL server using the `pgx` driver.

#### Example for PostgreSQL:

```bash
chicha-isotope-map --port=8765 --db-type=pgx --db-host=localhost --db-port=5432 --db-user=postgres --db-pass=yourpassword --db-name=isotope_db --pg-ssl-mode=prefer
```

- `--db-type`: The type of the database (`genji`, `sqlite`, or `pgx`). Default is `genji`.
  - **pgx**: Use this for PostgreSQL, powered by the `pgx` driver.
- `--db-host`: PostgreSQL database host. Default is `127.0.0.1`.
- `--db-port`: PostgreSQL port. Default is `5432`.
- `--db-user`: PostgreSQL username. Default is `postgres`.
- `--db-pass`: PostgreSQL password.
- `--db-name`: PostgreSQL database name. Default is `isotope_db`.
- `--pg-ssl-mode`: SSL mode for PostgreSQL. Default is `prefer`.

_Example for running with PostgreSQL using default settings but a custom database:_

```bash
chicha-isotope-map --db-type=pgx --db-name=my_custom_db
```

This will connect to a PostgreSQL database named `my_custom_db` on `localhost:5432` with user `postgres` and no password, using `pgx` as the driver.



### Web Interface:

1. Open <a href="http://localhost:8765" target="new">http://localhost:8765</a> in your browser.
2. Upload your data using the `Upload` button.
3. Hover over a marker ‚Äî and the invisible world will open before you. Discover the radiation dose, the time of the measurement, and the location where isotopes left their marks.

## ‚ò¢Ô∏è **Radiation and Its Traces**

What is radiation? It‚Äôs like a whispering wind in the mountains, something no one hears, yet it‚Äôs there. But our program is someone with extraordinary hearing. It sees what you cannot. It will tell you where and when that extra microroentgen appeared. It will show you how isotopes scattered through the city, fell into a quiet pond, or got lost in the old forest. Their danger lies in the fact that they don‚Äôt just sit on the ground like forgotten coins. No, they seep into the soil, the water, and the plants. You go about your life, eating apples, drinking water from a well, and isotopes quietly sneak inside. The doses accumulate, like little bunnies multiplying in your body. Quietly, unnoticed. But still dangerous.
